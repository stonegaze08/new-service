### Setup and Connect a node to the Mainnet

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Before proceeding, please make sure that your machine meets the hardware and software <Link href="../juneo" style={{ color: 'green', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>node requirements</Link>.
</Callout>

First, you should transfer the project files found <Link href="https://github.com/Juneo-io/juneogo-binaries" style={{ color: 'green', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>here</Link> to your server. If you have git installed on your server, you may execute the following commands:

```js copy
cd ~

git clone https://github.com/Juneo-io/juneogo-binaries
```
The required files will now be found in the `juneogo-binaries` folder in your home directory.

### Configuring the initial binary files
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
If you previously ran a node on the Socotra Testnet, updating the binaries will bring you directly on Mainnet.
</Callout>
The binary files required to run JuneoGo are:
- juneogo
- jevm
- srEr2XGGtowDVNQ6YgXcdUb16FGknssLTGUFYg7iMqESJ4h8e

To grant execution permissions of the binary files, please execute the following commands:

```js copy
chmod +x ~/juneogo-binaries/juneogo
chmod +x ~/juneogo-binaries/plugins/jevm
chmod +x ~/juneogo-binaries/plugins/srEr2XGGtowDVNQ6YgXcdUb16FGknssLTGUFYg7iMqESJ4h8e
```
After this, the juneogo binary should be moved to the home directory. The remaining two binaries should be moved to the `~/.juneogo/plugins` directory.

```js copy
mv ~/juneogo-binaries/juneogo ~

mkdir -p ~/.juneogo/plugins

mv ~/juneogo-binaries/plugins/jevm ~/.juneogo/plugins
mv ~/juneogo-binaries/plugins/srEr2XGGtowDVNQ6YgXcdUb16FGknssLTGUFYg7iMqESJ4h8e ~/.juneogo/plugins
```
The structure of your *home directory* should resemble the following:

```js copy
├── juneogo
├── .juneogo/
│   ├── plugins/
│   │   └── jevm
│   │   └── srEr2XGGtowDVNQ6YgXcdUb16FGknssLTGUFYg7iMqESJ4h8e
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
If these files are structured differenty than above, you will not be able to connect your node.
</Callout>

You may now connect the node to the network by executing the juneogo binary with the following command:

*For Mainnet use *:

```js copy
./juneogo
```

*For Socotra Testnet use* :
```js copy
./juneogo --network-id="socotra"
```
This will start fetching blocks and bootstrapping your node.
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Please make sure this process keeps running in the background. If the execution of the juneogo executable stops, your node will be inactive.
</Callout>
You may check if the node has boostrapped with the following call:

```js copy
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.isBootstrapped",
    "params": {
        "chain":"JUNE"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

```js filename="OUTPUT"
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "isBootstrapped": true
  },
  "id": 1
}
```
After the bootstrapping process has completed, <Link href="../juneo/add-validator" style={{ color: 'green', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>you may proceed to the next step</Link>
