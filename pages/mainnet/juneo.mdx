The Testnet is part of our development process. New features will be deployed later on where they can be battle tested together with our community. 20+ blockchains will be pre-deployed on the Genesis Testnet.
The final list of blockchains for the Mainnet will depend on activity and community interest, and will likely consist of around 12 blockchains.


## Stakes and fees
- The minimum stake on Mainnet is 100 JUNE, where as the maximum stake is 30,000 JUNE. On the Socotra Testnet, the minimum stake is 1 JUNE, and the maximum stake is 30,000 JUNE. You will also need additional funds to pay for transaction fees.

- The minimum staking period is 14 days on Mainnet and on Socotra Testnet. The maximum staking period for both networks is 365 days.

- Any delegator staking their funds on your node will pay you the delegation fee, which is 12% of their reward. Delegators can stake no more than x4 of your own stake.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
A node cannot be a validator on a MCN longer than it is a validator on the Juneo Primary Network. If you wish to deploy a MCN and add your node as a validator, we recommend staking on the Juneo Primary Network for at least 15 days. Once you have staked your tokens, you will be able to deploy a MCN and add your node as a validator to it for the minimum required validation period.

## Node requirements

| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 |
| :----- | :----: |
| CPU| 4 cores |
| RAM   |  8 GiB   |
| Storage | 160 GiB SSD (500 GiB SSD on Mainnet)  |
|Network | 5 Mbps |

## Network
At least 5 Mbps bandwidth (both upload and download) is required to run a validator node.

The node needs to accept connections from the Internet on the network ports `9651` (and optionally port `9650` to allow remote RPC calls). To enable port access on macOS, use Apple documentation. On Linux, use `ufw` firewall:

```js copy
sudo ufw allow 9650
sudo ufw allow 9651 
```
 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Running your node behind NAT is not recommended. Home installation is not recommended except for testing purposes.
</Callout>

If you're running a node on a home computer, it's most likely that you have a dynamic IP. You will need to either ask your ISP to assign a permanent public address, or set up port forwarding of port `9651` (and optionally `9650`) from the internet to your node computer. Please reference your router documentation.

An active node maintains thousands of live TCP connections, keep this in mind when choosing the router for such installation. A cheap router can cause network problems and make your node considered offline because of poor connection. Being online less than 80% of staking period means losing your rewards.

## Date and time synchronization

To enable time synchronization on Linux, please run the the command timedatectl in your terminal. 

If the NTP service parameter is set to no, then your node't time may get out of sync. Set up time synchronization by running the command:

```js copy
timedatectl set-ntp on
```
Run timedatectl again, and the parameter System clock synchronized should now be set to yes.

For time synchronization on macOS, please follow their <Link href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/set-the-date-and-time-automatically-mchlp2996/mac" style={{ color: 'green', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>documentation</Link>.
