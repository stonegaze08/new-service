Story Protocol's mission is to unleash an entirely new way to create, govern, and license IP on-chain, ultimately forming an ecosystem of “story legos” that can be remixed and composed. Story Protocol provides a streamlined framework to manage the entire lifecycle of IP development, enabling features like provenance tracking, frictionless licensing and revenue sharing. Made for creators across all media – prose, images, gaming, audio and more – applications built on Story Protocol give writers and artists the ability to track their work's provenance, allowing anyone to contribute and remix while capturing the value of their contributions.
