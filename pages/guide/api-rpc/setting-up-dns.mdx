# Setting up DNS

## Prerequisites

### Domain

You will need to have your own domain name first before we can continue.
If you don't have your domain yet, you can Get your domain here (https://www.namecheap.com/)

### Cloudflare

You need to sign up for Cloudflare account if you don't have it already. Free plan is enough (https://www.cloudflare.com/)

## DNS Management

We will use Cloudflare as our DNS Manager. You can plan ahead for which DNS do you want to use.

In this case, we will use our crossfi setup as example.

### Cloudflare Setup

After you registered to Cloudflare, you will see your dashboard, click on "Add a site" to continue

Fill in your domain name (example: zulnaaa.com), then click continue

![dns](/asset/api/gd2.png)

Cloudflare will prompt you to update your nameserver settings to their nameserver, you can set it up in your domain provider
