# Setting up SSL

## Prerequisite

You need to have snapd installed.
This step already covered in Server Preparation

And remove any previous certbot version installed by executing command below:

```js copy
sudo apt-get remove certbot
```

## Setting up CertBot

### CertBot Installation

We will use CertBot as our SSL manager
You can install it by using below commands:

```js copy
sudo snap install --classic certbot
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
sudo snap set certbot trust-plugin-with-root=ok
```
### CertBot DNS Plugin

Since we're using Cloudflare as our DNS Manager, we need to install Cloudflare plugin using command below:

```js copy
sudo snap install certbot-dns-cloudflare
```

### Get your credential API Token

To obtain your Cloudflare API token, follow these steps:

- Log in to your Cloudflare account.

- Go to the Profile section.

- Select API Tokens.

- Click on Create Token.

- For this case, you only need "Edit zone DNS" permissions.

- Once you've configured the token, click Continue to summary and then Create Token.

- Make sure to copy your new API token and securely store it; you wonâ€™t be able to see it again.

After you obtained your Cloudflare API Token, you need to put it in a file called certbot.ini in your server with format like below:

```js copy
dns_cloudflare_api_token = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
```

you can use your text editor or this command below to write it into a file directly

```js copy
echo 'dns_cloudflare_api_token = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567' > ~/certbot.ini
```
### Generate SSL

After you finished previous steps, now we need to generate the SSL.
You can do it by executing below command:

```js copy
certbot certonly \
  --dns-cloudflare-propagation-seconds 60 \
  --dns-cloudflare \
  --dns-cloudflare-credentials ~/certbot.ini \
  -d *.zulnaaa.com
```
## Re-Configure NGINX to use SSL

In Routing using NGINX, we've already set up our domain to point to correct endpoint. But it's still using HTTP. Now, we will set it up so we can use HTTPS.

Edit your config by opening your previous config with this command

```js copy
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/airchain-api-testnet
```

And replace the config with this


```js copy
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name crossfi-testnet-api.cryptonode.id;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
server {
    listen 443 ssl;

    server_name airchains-api-testnet.zulnaaa.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/zulnaaa.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/zulnaaa.com/privkey.pem;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
    ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_session_timeout 5m;
    ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
    ssl_stapling on;
    ssl_stapling_verify on;

    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods' 'GET,POST,OPTIONS';
    add_header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' 'Authorization,Accept,Origin,DNT,X-CustomHeader,Keep-Alive,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Content-Range,Range';

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1317;
        
        add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;
        add_header Access-Control-Max-Age 3600;
        add_header Access-Control-Expose-Headers Content-Length;
        
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

Repeat the same process for other endpoints and you will have all of your endpoints with SSL enabled
